## Homework 5.1: Starting to understand more complex French

* Login to Github and approve my pull request to get the file `homework-5.1.md` in your `assignments` repository.
* Log into Cloud9 and use `git pull` to get the file into your workspace.
 
* Find [the Wordpress project on Github][wordpress], fork it into your own account, and clone it into a Cloud9 workspace.
* Open your Wordpress workspace and find a file that has some branching _if-then-else_ logic; look for some juicy conditionals and guard clauses.
* Copy-paste your examples into `homework-5.1.md` (this file) and attempt to identify the conditions with comments like so:
> USERNAME/Wordpress/path/to/file.php:00
> ```php
>   if ( $mom_says == 'yes' ) // if mom says yes
> ```

* Save your file locally, add and commit it with git, and push your changes to your Github account.
* **Bonus points**: open a pull request back to the original repo with your work to date.

My example:                  09/20/2013

	if ( empty( $_POST['user_login'] ) ) {
		$errors->add('empty_username', __('<strong>ERROR</strong>: Enter a username or e-mail address.'));
	} else if ( strpos( $_POST['user_login'], '@' ) ) {
		$user_data = get_user_by( 'email', trim( $_POST['user_login'] ) );
		if ( empty( $user_data ) )
			$errors->add('invalid_email', __('<strong>ERROR</strong>: There is no user registered with that email address.'));
	} else {
		$login = trim($_POST['user_login']);
		$user_data = get_user_by('login', $login);
	}

*If the user login username post is empty, then error "Enter a username or e-mail address." will be sent. 
*If that's not the case but the user logs in with an invalid email then there will be no data for the user and error "There is no user registered with that email address." will be sent.
*If neither of those are the case and the user logs in the post with correct username/email adress, then the users' data will be recieved and logged in successfully.
